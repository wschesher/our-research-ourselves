<h2>Research Question</h2>
<p>I first started thinking about this type of scholarship/research after reading and watching Adams et al.’s webtext, “TechnoFeminisms: (Re)Generations and Intersectional Futures.” The piece includes snippets from a virtual interview with thirteen technofeminists from computers and writing. Since I wouldn’t be able to share physical space with folx for a project this semester, the model of the virtual interview of floating heads offered me a moment of possibility. While the Adams et al. piece isn’t a duoethnography (or rather a polyethnography), the emphasis on storytelling as data and ways of knowing; the importance history and story plays in the tellings, also aligned with my interests in feminist research methods and praxis (Legg; Royster and Kirsch; Given “Feminist Research”). I knew I wanted to do a duoethnography after researching the methodology and reading examples; however, Adams et al.’s piece presented a possibility of highlighting our distinct voices and perspectives through the use of video.</p>

<p>The guiding framework and question for this project is: How does and/or has faculty mentorship influenced graduate student researcher development in Writing Studies graduate programs?</p>

<h2>Methodology</h2>
<p>Duoethnography as a method involves two or more researchers participating in a conversation. As Sawyer and Norris write:</p>

<blockquote>In duoethnography, two or more researchers work in tandem to dialogically critique and question the meanings they give to social issues and epistemological constructs. Working with a critical partner, duoethnographers select social phenomenon or themes to investigate….In this process, they seek not commonalities but differences as they collaboratively develop a transformative text. Examining personal and cultural artifacts (Chang, 2008), stories, memories, compositions, texts, and critical incidents, duoethnographers excavate the temporal, social, cultural, and geographical cartography of their lives, making explicit their assumptions and perspectives. (2)</blockquote>
<p>The process and the interactions between the researchers are the research, both the conversations and the analyses.</p>

<p>Drawing from the tradition of autoethnography, it is a relatively new methodology with a few sketched out structures for what counts as a duoethnography; however, scholars like Breault have argued that duoethnography needs a more formalized process to establish validity and integrity. In identifying what makes a duoethnography a duoethnography, Sawyer and Norris provide the following tenets of the methodology in their book Duoethnography (15-22):</p>
<ul>
<li>Currerre as Frame for Investigation and Transformation</li>
<li>Voices “Bracket In”</li>
<li>Self as Research Site, Not Topic</li>
<li>(Re)storying Self and Other</li>
<li>Quest(ion), Not Hero/Victim</li>
<li>Fluid, Recursive, Layered Identity</li>
<li>Understandings Not Found: Meanings Created, Exposed, and Transformed</li>
<li>Emergent, Not Prescriptive</li>
<li>Communal yet Critical Conversations as a Dialogic Frame</li>
<li>Trust and Recognition of Power Differentials</li>
<li>Place as Participant</li>
<li>Literature as Participant</li>
<li>Difference as Heurism</li>
<li>Reader as Coparticipant and Active Witness</li>
</ul>
<p>Sawyer and Norris note these tenets are offered as guidelines and “working principles rather than methodological steps” as one would find in a structured methodology like grounded theory (14). Therefore, duoethnography as a methodology is both a framework and a process, one guided by the researchers’ self-reflection, willingness to participate in the process, and the dialogic nature of the study. As mentioned in the SAGE Encyclopedia of Qualitative Research Methods description of duoethnography, “Each group of researchers can and will adapt the method to their unique circumstances using the basic tenets as a guide. The aim of duoethnography is to promote and articulate research conversations in dialogue. Making it overly prescriptive is antithetical to its dialogic nature” (Given “Duoethnography” 235). Therefore, the methodology is malleable and reflective of the intentions and journey of the researchers.</p>

<p>Duoethnography as a methodology has been common in fields like education (Formenti et al.; Snipes and LePeau; Higgins et al.), Black feminist theory (Huckaby and Weinburgh), Critical Race Studies (Hummel and Takayoshi), and even as a dissertation project for Schultz in a Parks, Recreation, and Tourism program at the University of Utah. However, in writing studies, duoethnography is not a common or utilized methodology. But with recent turns in identifying narrative as ways of knowing (Powell et al.; Legg; Royster and Kirsch), I believe duoethnography can contribute an additional methodology to folx doing this type of knowledge creation and research. Therefore, beyond participating in this project to consider the primary research question and the rabbit-trails that followed, this research also offers a potential methodological framework for folx in writing studies as a discipline.</p>

<p>Research methods fascinate me because they are attempts at offering questions and then identifying possibilities for these questions, especially since not every question will have an answer. And a key part of methodologies is design.</p>
<blockquote><b>Will: I don't know this is like totally an unfleshed-out like thought. But like um yeah, the way in which we, like even how we do research I think like it can be. It can come from like personal interests, but also maybe like ways in which you like see the world. And like ways in which you interact with the world. So you're like oh, like I kind of wanted to do something like this? And like it makes sense for me to do this. Um yeah, and I don't, I mean again that's an unfleshed out thought, but like yeah.</b></blockquote>

<p>Therefore, the design can reflect a way of knowing and a way of thinking. And I believe duoethnography as praxis and research methodology embodied feminist research and praxis. As Given explains in the chapter “Feminist Epistemology,” feminist epistemology includes considering power dynamics, gender, race, culture, social class, and other social categories (331). Given then mentions Michelle Fine’s point that feminist research praxis and epistemology “should also avoid ‘othering’ participants in the research process by, for example, requesting that participants share much information about themselves while the researcher shares little or no information about her- or himself. Such a dynamic often further exacerbates the [existing] power dynamic” (as cited in Given “Feminist Epistemology” 334). Duoethnography may offer a possibility to counter the traditional power dynamic of other types of dialogic scholarship (although Schultz offers the possibility that duoethnography’s design still inscribes a power dynamic since often one researcher will ask another researcher to participate in the study). Furthermore, Handforth and Taylor discuss Bhavnani’s three principles of feminist research in their own duoethnography of becoming feminist researchers. Bhavani’s three principles are “[T]hat feminist research be accountable, that it should be cognisant [sic] of power relationships and positioning by taking into account the ‘micro-politics of the research encounter’ and that it should be aware of difference–and use them as a touchstone to reflect on our research” (as cited in Handforth and Taylor 628). These tenets of feminist research are present in the reflexive and dialogic nature of duoethnography.</p>

<p>Given notes feminist researchers and feminist research praxis includes “the practice of reflexivity throughout the research process” to identify where a person’s subjectivity and situated knowledges come from (“Feminist Epistemology” 335-336; Given “Subjectivity”). This includes incorporating “emotions and values as critical lenses in research” and “paying attention to the specific ways in which one’s own agendas impact the research at all points in the research process–from selecting the research problem to designing the method and the ways ones analyzes and interprets the findings” (Given “Feminist Research Methods” 336; 338).</p>

<p>Finally, Gelms and Edwards, writing about technofeminist research praxis incorporating narrative, identify a tension of feminist research practice in academic spaces:</p>
<blockquote>Jen Almjeld and Kristine Blair (2012), for example, noted that feminist researchers regularly encounter questions of validity as they deviate from the patriarchal research traditions so commonplace in the academy. In short, feminist research and methodologies are at risk of being deemed not academic enough to “count” as “real” research. (Gelms and Edwards “Platform Rhetorics and Feminist Methodologies”)</blockquote>

<p>Therefore, in my argument for incorporating duoethnography as a feminist research method for writing studies folx, I recognize there are existing arguments that feminist research methods are not considered valid or rigorous enough for academic research. However, there are feminist researchers in writing studies that I believe could incorporate duoethnography as a methodology, further advocating for storytelling as method.</p>

<h2>Method</h2>
<center><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XYILHwVRllg" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></center>

<p>In terms of the methods and process of the study, I first emailed Mandy to see if she would be willing to do this study with me, explaining that I would be recording the interview and then would use snippets of the video to enhance the write-up of the project. I also mentioned that I would be submitting an Institutional Review Board (IRB) application since in my mind, this was research with human participants, and in all of my training I have been told I would need an IRB application for any kind of research with human participants. However, because of the uniqueness of this semester (COVID-19), I reached out to Miami University’s IRB to determine if I could be able to submit an application without participating in their in-person trainings. I explained the research project and mentioned my CITI training to gauge my next steps. In response, the director of Miami University’s IRB noted I would not need to submit an application since this is more of a journalistic interview (which honestly felt a bit odd). I mentioned this to Mandy at the start of our interview.</p>
<blockquote><b>Will: The whole IRB thing. Like I think I've just been like taught so much that like any time you're doing something that you consider research, like you need an IRB….So like the fact that this doesn't....It just it's taken me a little bit to be like, okay it's gonna be okay.<br>
						<br><center>[...]</center><br>
Mandy: I think it’s like standards are changing, because again it’s like the IRB wasn’t really made for people like us who want to talk about learning and researching and writing. It’s more for like scientists who want to like test chemicals on people….So I feel like they’re trying to figure out how to make it more amenable to our kind of work.</b></blockquote>

<p>I understand the rationale of the IRB’s decision since I am not concealing my identity and I am not concealing Mandy’s identity. We are both embodied and present here; our visual presence and vocal presence are not hidden to provide anonymity or protect participants. But like I mentioned to Mandy, “[I] can still make, like [I] can still be ethical and [I] can still be transparent, like [I] don’t need this like system from the university.”
So, a part of this transparency and being ethical involved sending Mandy this write-up and the videos before submitting the seminar project to allow her to make edits to either the videos or the write-up. Again, since this is not a proper duoethnography (it is missing the second half of the process), the analysis is my own read on our conversation.</p>

<p>In terms of starting the conversation, I asked:</p>

<blockquote><b>Will: Can I ask like what, yeah, what's what's kind of your your research story in a sense? Or you're like, you know, I don't know a scholar story? I don't know like what word to use there, but like? Yeah.<br>
<br>Mandy: Yeah sure. And then just also up front too, I tend to ramble sometimes. And I tend to go in different directions, so if there's anything that you want me to return back to, just let me know and rein me back in and that's totally fine too.</b></blockquote>

<p>We started with sharing our stories of how we got to where we are today as researchers and academics, then transition to considering mentoring as a part of this process. We then discussed structural changes that need to take place for graduate students and ended on the concept of dérive as a metaphor or possibility for graduate education.</p>

<p>After the interview was finished, I watched the video a few times, taking notes on themes that were discussed, and started grouping these themes into larger categories. I was using in-vivo coding, which used our own language in identifying themes (Saldaña). I then took the audio file of the interview and uploaded this into Apple’s LogicProX audio editing software. I split the audio track when a new topic was addressed and moved this to a new track. After doing this through the entire audio track, I then grouped the audio tracks by theme (which you can see in Image 1). I used Apple’s iMovie software to then create smaller video clips, using the time stamps from the audio track in LogicProX to identify the clips. I watched the clips to ensure they were the same as the audio clip, and then exported each video separately. I edited the original 97 minute video down to 23 videos equaling about 52 minutes of watch-time.</p>

<p><center><b>Image 1.</b>LogicProX Audio Files Group by Theme</center></p>
<p>Once I had the video clips and identified the themes, I uploaded the clips to Youtube, marking the videos as unlisted so only folx with the links would be able to view them. Then I did research on the themes, allowing our conversation to direct the scholarship I found. This included research on mentoring in writing studies, research about mentoring outside of writing studies, and finding duoethnographies, both methods texts and examples. I then edited the closed captioning in YouTube for accessibility purposes and started writing up my findings. Once I finished my findings, I sent them to Mandy who was then able to make comments/redactions to either the included videos or to text, ensuring I was being ethical not only in allowing Mandy to make changes, but also making sure I was not misrepresenting her comments.</p>
