<h1>Conclusions of Sorts</h1>

<p>In returning to the original research question/guiding framework, “How does and/or has faculty mentorship influenced graduate student researcher development in Writing Studies graduate programs?,” I’m not sure I can offer any concrete answers. It appears that for both Mandy and me, alongside our interactions with and mentoring from faculty, our personal experiences and interests as well as our administrative positions were key tenets in identifying how we do research and how we consider the process of research. Both of us mentioned starting our initial research interests from the perspective of students: Either in my study of my high school students or thinking through the experiences of my colleagues in my master’s program who were taking a research methods course as they were completing their final projects; or Mandy talking about her thinking about graduate students in a class, and then merging that with her administrative experience, which ultimately became her dissertation research (which was unconnected to her master’s project). These initial questions led to larger-systems level questions, which seems connected to our experiences working in administrative positions. Mandy mentions being exposed to this type of systems-level framework at the Howe Center for Writing Excellence, which included learning from and working with faculty and grad students at the center. I mentioned how my administrative experience allowed me to codesign an ongoing research project, which would not have happened if I did not have an existing relationship with that professor (they’re the person I talked about fantasy books with). Being involved in administrative work pushed me to think differently about my research questions, but also helped frame the relationship I built with my director. But this mentoring isn’t just about faculty. Building a network of other graduate students, which can include digital networking with folx at different institutions, like asking folx for master’s level CVs or even asking someone to participate in a duoethnography with you, can be ways to form connections and rely on more of a horizontal mentoring practice instead of the vertical top-down approach.</p>
<p>As a duoethnography (or half of a duoethnography), there isn’t a true ending or final conclusion. Instead, there are possibilities–ways the reader can connect and say, “Well this makes sense” or “What about these questions?” There are pencil smudges around the boundaries of this conversation, opening up avenues for further discussion and further collaboration.</p>

<blockquote><b>Mandy: It’s all big questions, I don’t even know if there are any answers.</b></blockquote>

<p>Mandy’s final summation basically captures both the process of duoethnography, but also in addressing the messiness of considering graduate education, mentoring, and even researcher identity. And again, while this conversation is not finished and this duoethnography is my particular read on/analysis, I do see some possible first steps folx can take to at least alleviate some of the trickiness of becoming a researcher and considering the role mentoring can play in this process. This includes explicitly talking about the purpose of graduate school and mentorship with both faculty and graduate students, providing opportunities for students to blend their personal interests into their work in a system that supports diversions and digressions (akin to dérive), and creating multiple ways of interactions between grad students from different cohorts and faculty. These may be small band-aids, but they provide possibilities for folx to be aware of how the system operates and how it can privilege certain students. As most mentors mentor grad students as they were mentored, having explicit conversations about how to incorporate feminist mentoring practices (Humble et al.) can provide avenues for changing the way mentorship models operate in programs. This includes demystifying genres, being aware of power dynamics (like top-down approaches to mentorship or questioning directionality and encouraging horizontal mentorship between grad students) and being explicit about the types of resistance folx may face either with their research topics (specifically if they are feminist research topics) or as participants in a department (if the department is not receptive to feminist scholars or scholarship) (Humble et al.). Graduate school is difficult and often incorporates systems and genres students may not be familiar with, and mentors can make these systems and genres explicit to students and help folx navigate their time in and beyond the academy (Humble et al.; Sharer et al.). No type of one-size-fits-all approach will address the systemic barriers that harm grad students, specifically folx of color, folx with varying gender expressions, and women in particular, but to not question the system means perpetuating the system.</p>

<p>Additionally, using duoethnography as a feminist research methodology allows for current graduate students to take a reflexive approach to their own learning and experiences. Having a critical conversation partner (Sawyer and Norris) and engaging in strategic contemplation (Royster and Kirsch) can not only transform the research praxis being done by graduate students, but by incorporating graduate student voices in scholarship about graduate students this may impact the scholarship reflecting graduate students. If scholarship on graduate education is coming from folx who are removed from graduate school, there is a potential for folx to misrepresent the system of graduate education (since they are either writing with a backwards facing view or are offering their perspectives on their current graduate students). Furthermore, the tension between identifying what “counts” as scholarship (as Gelms and Edwards note) can be a gatekeeping method for graduate students who are using innovative research methodologies and methods. Changing these perspectives takes buy-in and structural change. But structural change only happens when folx in a system want to make the change, which takes building connections in a department and forming those relationships (often starting through low-stakes interactions and informal meetings/conversations).</p>

<p>Finally, in addressing existing scholarship, Moore et al.’s work considers the perspectives of master’s students, but the majority of mentoring scholarship focuses on doctoral students and is often written by faculty scholars. Since master’s programs are typically two years, the consequences of not paying attention to master’s students means structural failures may have a greater impact on these students. In addressing structural changes, this needs to consider the perspectives of students in both master’s programs and doctoral programs. This may include asking students about their time in the program and offering possible models of mentorship that align with what students need. But without this explicit type of discussion, systems and practices of mentorship/mentoring will continue to rely on folx’s previous experiences with mentoring, re-creating the system from which faculty were mentored; reifying a system that needs changing.</p>
