<p>Our conversation then turned specifically to mentoring, including our experiences with mentoring, struggles in creating relationships with faculty in a new program (especially in the current semester where all interactions are virtual and by appointment), low-stakes interactions with faculty and other grad students as being an important component of relationship development and possible gateways to mentoring, and then considering possible models and examples of mentoring for grad students.</p>

<p>Scholars in disciplines such as family studies (Humble et al.), geography (Moss et al.), neuroscience (Liénard et al.), and communications (Moore et al.) have focused on mentoring graduate students and the benefits graduate students gain from being mentored. Humble et al. share their stories as grad students being mentored and consider what feminist mentoring looks like. The authors found the following themes of feminist mentoring, either through their own experiences or in existing scholarship:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li> nurturing relationships through self-disclosure related to the gendered topics being studied,</li>
<li> being intentional and thoughtful about power issues,</li>
<li> demystifying academic processes related to feminist resistance, and</li>
<li> working toward social change in a variety of ways. Several recommendations follow this analysis, including consideration of issues pertaining to the provision of guidance to graduate students in feminist research topics and analysis. (10)</li>
</ol>

<p>Moore et al. addressed the perspectives of both mentors and the mentees, specifically considering master’s students, which is different from the majority of research/scholarship on mentoring. Moore et al. found mentees wanted mentors who embodied “openness, motivation, enthusiasm, humility, and guidance” (8), while mentors wanted to work with students who embody the four following tenets: “(i) mirrored similarity, (ii) passion for learning, (iii) proactive self-starter, and (iv) eagerness to embrace challenge” (13). Moore et al. also mention mentoring offers master’s students four benefits: “(a) exploring new research areas, (b) participating in the qualitative research process from beginning to end, (c) collaborating with established faculty, and (d) deciding if pursuing a PhD and academic career is right for them” (18). This explicit mention of the research process reflects my own interests in this work, however, as I will note in the conclusion, there needs to be more work done for and with master’s level students.</p>

<p>Moss et al.’s work shares a lot of the same findings as Moore et al’s work; however, Moss et al. also consider the idea of self-mentoring through reflective practices like keeping a journal (423). The authors argue
The graduate student also shares a responsibility in the mentoring process, which includes taking ownership of the programme [sic] of study while at the same time engaging the mentor’s guidance and support. Graduate students need to view themselves as active contributors to the mentoring relationships, providing support, knowledge and intellectual stimulation for student peers” which will provide an “opportunity to build the foundations of a network of support and collaboration that will sustain them throughout their careers. (422)</p>

<p>So, to Moss et al., grad students are not simply empty vessels to be mentored but are co-agents in the mentoring process. This framing of graduate student responsibility can offer insight to how folx can talk about mentoring relationships in a program, explaining the process requires participation from both mentors and grad students.
In writing studies, there’s not a lack of scholarship on mentoring; however, this scholarship is often written by faculty reflecting on their own experiences of mentoring, not by graduate students considering their current experiences of mentoring and being a grad student. The book Stories of Mentoring: Theory & Practice, edited by Eble and Gaillet, offer insights into models of mentoring (Miles and Burnett; Love; Mullin and Braun); using the term colleague instead of mentor (Gaillet); mentoring as explicit or implicit, which can include watching how faculty interact and do their work (Baake et al.); teaching academic genres as a form of mentoring (Sharer et al.); and even how to mentor undergraduate students through a collaborative research process/project (Eaton et al.).</p>

<blockquote><b>Mandy: And it's interesting, because like as I found out from my research a couple years ago people aren't really trained how to do that. Like, for most professors who work with grad students they just kind of model it based on how they received it. And so if their advisor would give them a lot of written feedback or would have more meetings that's kind of like their go-to model for it until they start working with people, and they realize what's working and also what works with one person might not work for another.</b></blockquote>

<p>Humble et al.’s research references articles by Johnson and Luna and Cullen that make the claim that mentors are not trained how to mentor (Johnson “The intentional mentor: Strategies and guidelines for the practice of mentoring,” Luna and Cullen “Do graduate students need mentoring?” as cited in Humble et al. 2). And Moore et al. argue that folx who have been mentored are more willing to mentor graduate students (4). Therefore, how folx are mentored often reflects how they mentor in the future, which mirrors the above comment from Mandy’s own research.</p>

<p>Mandy and I then talked about different tenets of mentoring, in that mentoring privileges the bold, or mentoring can be as simple as asking for permission. However, we then landed on low-stakes interactions with faculty and other grad students as an important way to build rapport that can eventually lead to mentoring. Taken together, these ideas reflect possible complications in a semester where the majority of interactions between faculty and students are online. I mention feeling apprehension of emailing a professor unless I have a specific question; there’s not a natural or structured way for faculty and grad students to share space in a low-stakes environment, especially when everyone’s time is taken up with Zoom meetings (and asking a professor to talk over Zoom means adding another meeting to both my schedule and their schedule can sprinkle on a bit of guilt). These low stakes interactions can then lead to possible research opportunities and collaborations (like I mention about my experience in my master’s program, the low-stakes interaction was key to developing a relationship with a faculty member); however, a top-down approach to mentorship where grad students are expected to reach out to faculty privileges certain folx, more specifically the bold.</p>

<blockquote><b>Mandy: It's like this whole top-down mentorship thing assumes that you're a confident person comfortable just going up and bragging about yourself, putting yourself out there, saying like, "I study this area and I'm currently writing a paper, I think we should talk about it." Like I would never do that, I would literally like crawl into a corner and like cry.</b></blockquote>

<blockquote><b>Mandy: This one person wrote a really interesting article about um like a psychological contract between an advisor and an advisee, where you should maybe write down like what you each expect from the relationship, what some common rules might be...And I feel that might be the danger of someone like me who has known people for so long, because it's like I've been working with Liz in some capacity for five years now, so we know each other really well. Maybe it would be awkward to kind of step back and say how should this relationship formally be conducted, when we've already been doing it and it's also blended and blurred with different roles and different positions. So I see why it's a problem in general, and why it can be hard. But I do think if more people were to make it more explicit and say, "Let's figure out how to work together and what works for you," and also be open to changing that because you might think you want one thing and then you it happens and you're like well that actually wasn't very helpful–have that space. Okay fine, let's change it. I won't do that anymore, you know? Like at least for my own, like if I ever have grad students I'm gonna try to make an effort to really try to forefront that and pay attention to process in that way. It comes down to process, I guess. The actual day-to-day process writing movement through your relationship. That is important, it's central, but it's not always explicitly discussed.</b></blockquote>

<p>Again, this type of mentorship, or even this move of using a psychological contract, privileges the bold, or students who feel comfortable enough to ask a faculty member to engage in this type of norming and experience of talking about what works for them as learners and researchers. This takes self-awareness, but also may not be a process that a grad student even thinks about doing. This also questions the directionality of these experiences. Should faculty be asking questions about norming, or should grad students? And if this conversation isn’t brought up, then will faculty provide feedback in the same manner they were given feedback? </p>

<blockquote><b>Will: I think a lot of my mentoring experience kind of came from like me asking like, "Can I do this?" And it was almost, almost like moment of like permission that I was looking for. Because I didn't know if someone would like support that decision. Um, I don't know and I think that's it's a different way than I think I've framed "mentoring."</b></blockquote>

<p>I share a bit of my own perspective on my experience with mentoring. I would argue I have been mentored, but I also recognize I haven’t asked a faculty member to be my mentor (which includes my master’s program and my current program). Instead, I often found mentoring to be this process of asking for permission. I would have an idea, and then find out the institutional system didn’t allow for that to happen (specifically completing a thesis for my master’s program when the program structure just offered a research project of journal-article length). But I would not have reached out to faculty if I didn’t trust them or know them a little, either through low-stakes interactions (like I mention in my comment about fantasy books below) or in passing them in the halls and saying hello, maintaining our relationships.</p>

<blockquote><b>Mandy: I think mentoring is really key to education and to grad education. But it's also the more informal mentoring and the more less explicit mentoring, that I think can have some of the biggest impacts. Especially when taken all together. So of course, all of us have some degree of formal mentorship. During my master's, I had a formal thesis advisor, I had a administrative boss–those were two people who were responsible for my progress and who were supposedly meant to be people who I would go to if I had problems–and there's also other people and other things that kind of show up along the way. Um, and even now it's like some of the little things. Like passing along a CFP, emailing, "Hey I read this article, you might like it." Little things like that, again it's very invisible, it takes two seconds in an email. But that's kind of like all of a combination of all those things happening really helps me feel supported, not only as a student but like as a human, as a learner and things like that you know?...Things like that, like it's more informal and organic and it's kind of hard to to count or measure. But that really helped um over time kind of combine to make that for me. I'm not sure if that's even an answer to your question. That's just some thoughts that I had about where I've seen mentoring kind of come up to be important.</b></blockquote>

<blockquote><b>Will: Oh yeah, in my master's I think one of the like, one of the folks who I'm like working on a study with right now….one of the ways that we bonded was over like fantasy books. Like when we talked about Brandon Sanderson, and like that was that was an inroad. Like you know, but like that was like that kind of. Because to me it was almost like low stakes. Like it was a low stakes conversation that I could have with someone.<br>

<br>Mandy: Yeah.<br>

<br>Will: Having like a potential topic that's like low stakes like as a way to be like, "Like I see your humanity and you see mine."...especially if there's this kind of power dynamic….so like yeah. How do you, how do you go up to someone like that you respect and be like, "Can I just share space with you like?" ...Those little moments that I think, yeah, was a foundation on which like then I could, then I knew like okay, like I could ask this person a question. Um I don't know. I don't know, that to me was important, like that relationship aspect.</b></blockquote>

<blockquote><b>Mandy: I think trust is a really important thing and I've been thinking a lot about like choosing like a PhD advisor, and like you have to find somebody who you trust with your thinking. Because so much of it, before you even get to write the actual dissertation, it's just your thinking. Like you go into a meeting and you say "Here's what I'm thinking”....it's still very much located at the thought level, and when I go to get feedback it's kind of like, "Well this doesn't sound like what you always talk to me about. Like is this, are you just not representing yourself right, are you changing what you're thinking?" And so it is like almost like trusting somebody with your thoughts and those thoughts kind of like remaining somehow if that makes sense.</b></blockquote>

<blockquote><b>Will: And like I think, I mean some of the best conversations I had when I was doing my research was like….talking to colleagues, like talking to my my friends, and talking to like other people in my cohort. So like this idea like mentoring, like you know it came from people who were around me um but even then. Like it was similar structures were like, I had to have that like that trust with the person first. Um yeah, I I don't know.<br>

<br>Mandy: I think we need that we need all of that you know? Like even in the work that I've been doing, thinking about where grad students get supported. It comes, it needs to come from multiple places. Like you do need your advisor for some things, you do need your friends for others, you need maybe the writing center and people who aren't as familiar with your work. Maybe you need Twitter? Maybe you need to help have people you know help you out with a question or something on there. And it's, that's what makes it messy.</b></blockquote>

<blockquote><b>Will: I think selfishly, I also wanted to like ask you these questions because you know, I think this is maybe our fourth or fifth conversation....We don't know each other well enough for me to like text you and be like, "Hey what's your favorite bridge?" But like you know, so like to what degree like is this like an opportunity to be like, "Okay in sharing that like those experiences, like as a way like as a way of connecting like colleagues-wise."<br>

<br>Mandy: Oh yeah, and I think it is good. I mean it's hard sometimes. I mean a) It's hard because of the pandemic we're not all in the same building. Um but it can be, I think really valuable to find people across cohorts who have similar interests to you, you know? And because otherwise, I mean in one given cohort, I mean as far as I'm aware of, I think you and I are the only ones who specifically focus on graduate student learners in our research? Or who like came in kind of or have come to really think about that, so it's kind of nice to find your people throughout it, you know? Whereas other people, like the rhetorical theory people might kind of come together in their thoughts in a certain way. I feel like the WPA people sort of find their way together too. Um so I, I kind of like this. It's like the kind of like the old school like community of like finding your people and that kind of thing um that's kind of nice.</b></blockquote>

<p>Taken together, these last five videos address the concepts of low-stakes interactions and building your own personal mentoring network, which is a part of why I asked Mandy to participate in this study. I wanted to get to know her a little more, and even though a research project may not be a low-stakes interaction, there was an intention of collegiality behind the conversation. The conversation allowed us to talk through our past experiences and share those with each other. Mandy addresses how choosing an advisor is built on trust, specifically trusting someone with your thinking and in-progress writing; however, this process may not be apparent to students unless they have either talked through this with a mentor or if they are reflecting on what they need as a student. As I have mentioned previously, the process through which folx learn how to do this may often be unstated. How would explicit mention of this type of personal-network building (or even explicit conversations about how mentoring operates in a department) change how graduate students relate to other graduate students and faculty in a program? And like the argument about top-down mentoring favoring the bold, if the expectation rests on new graduate students, they may not feel comfortable reaching out to folx in other cohorts (which could stem from similar fears and guilt about adding meetings to already busy and Zoom-laden schedules). Identifying and incorporating low-stakes interactions on a departmental level may provide ways that new graduate students can feel guilt free in meeting faculty and other graduate students. While this semester is a bit different because of COVID-19 and virtual interactions, there should still be a push to incorporate these types of interactions (and I would argue that it is even more important this semester because of the uniqueness of the semester).</p>
