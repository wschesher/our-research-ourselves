<h1>Our Stories</h1>

<p>I first wanted us to share our stories before delving into the guiding framework/question because I believe understanding how we got here not only establishes a baseline of trust (since we’re being vulnerable in sharing our pasts with each other), but because it provides context for who we currently are as researchers. This type of storying uses Gelms and Edward’s, Adams et al.’s, and Royster and Kirch’s examples of using one’s past experiences as valid forms of knowing when talking about a topic at hand. Adams et al. each discuss their previous experiences with technology and as technofeminist researchers to identify past, current, and future possibilities for technofeminist research (n.p.). Royster and Kirsch identify critical imagination and strategic contemplation as being key tenets of feminist research in writing studies and use Monberg’s suggestion to study living folx instead of those who have died to better understand the ways systems impact current bodies (49). Finally, Gelms and Edwards include small stories connecting their own identities to their research on platform rhetorics and write, “It’s our hope that the reader see these stories as a method, of sorts, for confronting how it is our researcher identities are inextricable from our personal ones” (“Lived Experiences” n.p.).</p>

<p>Mandy has an undergrad degree in rhetoric and writing, so her introduction to the field started much earlier than mine. Mandy talks about her early work in the writing center:</p>

<blockquote><b>Mandy: [It was] very research heavy. And they wanted us to like do research, and so I actually did a couple of presentations at IWCA and then ECWCA, where I would like observe sessions and report on what I found, and things like that. And so I think that's kind of like the the space that helped me feel like a researcher, where I was actually taking knowledge that I learned about in class and then applying it in my tutoring sessions. So I was putting into practice how to ask questions and how to focus on rhetorical nuances, not just grammar and all that stuff. But I was also trying to interact with the larger scholarly conversation by going to conferences and hearing people speak and presenting my own research.</b></blockquote>

<p>This experience “encouraged [her] to go to graduate school. And [she] had professors who were like, yes if you want to go to grad school you can.” Mandy’s experiences in a writing center that encouraged undergraduate researchers to conduct studies was an initial building block to ending up in grad school.</p>

<p>Mandy then started a master’s degree at Miami University and eventually decided to stay at Miami for her PhD. I asked her if this was also a question of time.</p>
<blockquote><b>Will: So like, you were at Miami for two years, you know….Like did that kind of influence any decision of yours? About like kind of, creating more like sustained I guess, I don’t even know what word I’m look like, yeah. There’s this like sustained relationships you’re like you know developing over, you know six to *excuse me* six to seven years as opposed to two?<br>

<br>Mandy: Let’s be real, like you know Liz is my chair now. I’ve known her since the first year of my master’s like this is my fifth year knowing her not my third year….And it helps I think for someone, just to know someone well, like personally and scholarly. Like she kind of knows where I’ve come up from and like she’s seen me grow from my first year of my masters.</b></blockquote>

<p>But Mandy also explains that part of her decision to stay at Miami is because two new faculty were hired to start at the same time she would start the PhD program, allowing her an opportunity to get to know and work with new faculty.</p>

<p>Mandy finished her comprehensive exams at the beginning of the fall 2020 semester and has been involved in administrative work since her master’s degree.</p>
<blockquote><b>Mandy: I feel like I'm at a really interesting space right now, having just finished coursework last semester. I did my exams at the end of this summer and I submitted my prospectus at the beginning of this fall. So I really feel like I finally arrived where I'm officially a researcher, but I don't think. I think I've always been a researcher, but it's like the way that the system is set up, it's like you're technically allowed to start conducting your dissertation research after you finish these milestones. So it's interesting to me that I'm officially at the milestone, but I still see how I've been doing my research all throughout.</b></blockquote>

<p>She then explains how her dissertation project stemmed from her work with The Howe Center for Writing Excellence, and how her administrative experience and even her coursework led her to thinking about graduate education.</p>
<blockquote><b>Mandy: And so that work it's all for my assistantship, but it was also born from my own personal research and the two kind of intermingle. I don't know if either would have happened without the other kind of in a weird way. And so now for my dissertation, I'm looking at basically how we change systems of graduate education and writing.</b></blockquote>

<p>And as noted in the [[Research Overall]] video, Mandy’s experience in admin work also impacts the way she designs her research. She says:</p>
<blockquote><b>Mandy: “[At The] Howe Center we do adopt this very like systems-focused framework, where you don't see our job as a WAC program to change individual teachers practices….So it definitely goes into the work that we do at the Howe Center too. And I guess personally, I'm I'm taking from that too in my own things that I do. I like following up with people over time. I'm not trying to do some kind of a one-shot, like I'm going to teach you everything you need to know.”</b></blockquote>


<h2>Will</h2>

<p>My undergraduate degree is in Intercultural Studies: Community Development with a minor in Child and Family studies. I had no clue what I was going to do with this degree, but I eventually found a non-traditional teaching program and got placed to teach high school English (I could use my Intercultural Studies background to provide lenses to analyze literature). I presented at two conferences in undergrad. One was undergrad focused, and the other was because I wrote a paper for one of my minor-focused classes about brain development and children’s spiritual formation, and my professor asked if she could use it for a book chapter she was writing, which would also result in a conference presentation. This type of research was secondary research (I am in no way a scientist or a developmental psychologist looking at brains), and it’s technically my only publication even though I wasn’t really involved in the writing process. My professor took my work (alongside three other former undergrads) and incorporated it into the chapter.</p>

<p>As I was teaching high school English, I knew I didn’t know how to teach writing, so I signed up for the East Texas Writing Project at Texas A&M Texarkana (TAMUT). And it was here where I was first introduced to writing studies as a discipline (I had never heard of it before since the English program at my undergrad was literature focused). I learned that TAMUT was starting a master’s certificate in teaching writing, so I signed up.</p>
<blockquote><b>Will: [T]hat's where I first took like comp theory and I um, you know it was like grant and proposal writing and some other stuff, and then one of the classes was like you know research um in composition. And it was like I think the composition theory course was really important because it was like oh let's learn about like this history, let's learn about all these things, maybe some of the stuff that you got in like undergrad. Um but then it was like, and I did you know, did more like theoretical type research there where I was like proposing something, and like hey let's you know think about this idea. Um but then in the research in comp course I was like, you know we were reading examples we were also reading like you know methods texts. And it was like," Oh there's like a structured way that you can ask questions?"</b></blockquote>

<p>The methods course first introduced me to knowledge making in writing studies, and also required me to conduct my own primary research. And this is where my interest in writing studies and research methods coalesced.</p>
<blockquote><b>Will: Oh like this is how you can ask a question and then you kind of make some method like methodology choices and methodological choices about like what you want to do and how you want to ask that question.</b></blockquote>

<p>In my master’s program I was also involved in admin work and used my experience as the Associate Director of the Writing Program to conduct research on values in writing programs. However, while taking a research methods course I started to form my thesis research question about preparing master’s level graduate students as researchers (which is partially where this current study comes from, at least the interest in researcher identity).</p>

<blockquote><b>Will: We were in the methods course like my spring semester my first year, and so the second year students were literally working on their like culminating projects as they were in the methods course. And I was like, "How? How?"</b></blockquote>

<center><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HVQwm7tNyZs" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></center>

<blockquote><b>Will: But like yeah, I mean there is this like process and you, I think similar to like learning anything else, like even like learning like how to write and learning how, like that's a lifelong kind of continuous process. Like I think doing research is too. Um and so for me, like it was I think I wanted to focus specifically on master's students because you know, I think folks go to grad school for different reasons. Like there's some folks who are in a master's program who are like, "No I want to get a PhD and I want to like, you know, maybe get a job in higher ed." And you know, depending on the job market and what that looks like because that's always like a oh shit moment. But like um no, and so but also like with master's students, it's like there's some folks who don't who are like, "No I don't want a PhD." Um and so how do you like, as a, how do you design a program in a way that like is supportive of both?</b></blockquote>

<p>So, my thesis research connected to the lived experiences of my peers, but also reflected my own process of learning how to do research from methods courses. These connections to lived and embodied experiences is a connection Mandy and I share with our research on graduate students as learners, writers, and researchers.</p>

<p>In considering my own experiences with research, both at TAMUT and in my master’s, I explained to Mandy this tension I still have in calling myself a researcher:</p>
<blockquote><b>Will: As a first year phd student like, there are moments where I go like, yeah I feel comfortable calling myself a researcher. But then there are moments I'm like no, like I I'm not. I'm not. And so like, where does that like identity come from?</b></blockquote>
