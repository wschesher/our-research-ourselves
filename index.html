<h1>Introduction</h1>

<p>This is a pilot duoethnography. It’s two grad students talking about their research, mentoring, and their process of becoming. Less of an interview, the conversation follows rabbit trails, loops back on itself, and doesn’t adhere to a script. While this is often the first step in a  duoethnography (Sawyer and Norris), because this is a pilot, the next step in a traditional duoethnography hasn’t happened yet. It is more one-sided than a true duoethnography because this is a seminar project–I am being assessed on the text that’s being produced. If this is edited and reworked for any kind of publication, the steps and process of a true duoethnography will happen (more information on the scope and process of duoethnography will be discussed below in the “Methods” section).</p>
<p>Mandy is in her third year of the PhD program at Miami in the English: Composition and Rhetoric program, and I am in my first semester of the same program. Mandy finished her comprehensive exams earlier this semester and is working on her dissertation; I’m fretting about the comprehensive exams which I won’t take for another two years. I asked Mandy to do this with me because I knew we had similar interests in working with and researching graduate students, and because she’s someone I admire.</p>
<p>We first met at the Conference for College Composition and Communication (CCCC’s) in March, 2019. I was sitting with a friend at a publisher's party, and Mandy came up because she knew my friend. We talked briefly, and continued interacting intermittently through Twitter following the conference. In the fall of 2019, I was applying to PhD programs and put out a call on Twitter for examples of CVs for master’s students. I had seen the CVs of my professors, but I was looking specifically for master’s level students to see what kind of CV I should be crafting for my PhD applications. Mandy (and a handful of other folx) reached out and sent me her materials, and then offered to talk to me about PhD programs in general and the program at Miami. We used GoogleMeet to talk. When I was accepted to Miami, I had a campus visit and Mandy attended the dinner where I got to talk with other grad students about the program, and was there the next day when I got a walk-through of what Miami had to offer. We texted a few times as I was making my decision, and then saw each other virtually at the start of the Fall 2020 semester. And after agreeing to participate in this duoethnography, on October 22 we had an hour and a half long Zoom meeting.</p>
<p>In total we’ve basically had 5 conversations, split between face-to-face conversations in person and face-to-face conversations over the computer. I provide this context because it will come up again in the “Mentoring” section, but also to possibly explain my awkwardness in the videos. I don’t really like video chats because I can see myself. I am reminded of my own embodiment (Given “Embodied Knowledge”)–I see the cis-white male staring back at me and the privilege inherent in this embodiment. One that needs to continually be checked and questioned. And yet this process is also awkward because it feels very different from making eye contact with a person you’re talking to, because to make “eye contact” here is to stare at the small black dot next to the illuminated green light indicating my camera is on–that little light next to the dark void, a further reminder that I am interacting through a mediated space. And then to have the person do the same when they’re talking as I shift my gaze down to the person’s eyes, tricking myself to believe that we’re making eye contact. To talk openly and vulnerably and honestly about our experiences and identities as researchers is difficult enough without the further complication of the screen. In this case, the Zoom call becomes its own “terministic screen” (Burke 1294)–a space of performance, a lens distorted and digital. I am reminded of this performance with each glance and with each movement. My fidgets are highlighted. My coffee mug hides my face. My eyes dart off screen. Moving makes me larger or smaller in the frame. The video can’t be smudged, so my verbal tics are here, even when I try to edit them away.</p>
<p>As I mentioned at the beginning, unlike a traditional interview, this was more of a conversation, going back and forth between the two of us; however, online-Zoom protocols have made their way here–there’s a sense of taking turns to talk, waiting for the other person to stop talking before one of us either asks a clarifying question or takes up the thread. I have experience with semi-structured interviews, but this was the first time where the interaction was supposed to be more balanced and even; a natural back and forth. This type of interaction emphasizes the attempt to assuage power dynamics, and to provide an equal give and take between the researchers (Given “Feminist Research”). But as seen in these videos, the give and take isn’t as casual or natural, which may have happened if we were sharing physical space with each other.</p>
<p>Finally, two technical notes: 1) Mandy was using Zoom to broadcast visually, but she was using her home phone to broadcast her voice. She explained this was a result of the internet not being super reliable at her home and is why her voice does not quite match her physically speaking in the videos. I had originally thought about editing this so it would match; however, it’s a reality and artifact of the virtual space we shared. 2) While a reader is encouraged to watch the videos as they appear in this text, I recognize not everyone will want to watch 23 videos totaling about 52 minutes of watch-time. Therefore, snippets (and at times extended quotes) from the interviews will be included in this write up and will be bolded. This will allow readers to watch the videos that interest them if they are pressed for time.</p>
