<p>	There were two topics that stemmed from our conversation that veered away from mentoring but concern the system of grad education. They were natural digressions (or possibly progressions) that allowed us to sum up our conversation, looking at patterns that emerged from our experiences. The first concerns identifying structures of graduate education, and then identifying the failures of systems of education that can harm graduate students, but not simply accepting this as set-in stone. This led to a conversation about the need and process of structural change, and how research itself can help address or offer possibilities for structural change.</p>

<blockquote><b>Mandy: I feel like we're both kind of getting at this idea of like flawed systems of academia….Like I just don't think we've given enough attention to re-imagining what this could and should look like you know what I mean?

<br>Will: It is it is a failure of a system. Um and then like I mean, I think for me, like even when talking like you know -sorry- like you know some folks at my masters I was like what if you just offered it in the fall?<br>

<br>Mandy: Yeah.<br>

<br>Will: But then you think about like first years, first year fall.<br>

<br>Mandy: I know.<br>

<br>Will: Your first course? It's like, "Hey what research questions do you have?" It's like, "I don't know." [Chuckling]<br>

<br>Mandy: I think you also get an important point and like this is what I'm also thinking. It's important to focus on the system, but we also can't abandon the individual struggling in the system, and that's hard part. And I've seen more of this work focusing on helping those people in the moment–let's put out these fires, let's help these people who are being harmed. And we need to do that, I'm not saying we shouldn't, but I also recognize the irony. Well if we don't fix the system, every year you're going to have more people filter in who are just going to keep struggling. And so we really need to kind of split our focus and more strategically work through how to maybe, it might be more work in the front end, but it might result in less work if you don't have to necessarily help.</b></blockquote>

<p>	Mandy then offered an example from her recent experience with her comprehensive exams, including a conversation her committee had about the exam process itself and where expectations come from when designing these types of benchmarks.</p>

<blockquote><b>Mandy: We actually learned that through our FLC. Rose Marie Ward came from the grad school and said, "Listen, all we require is an exam. We don't tell you what it's supposed to be. All we require for a dissertation is to upload the file to OhioLink. It's up to you all what you want that to be. You all think about what you want students to learn and what it should look like." And the faculty were just kind of like *phew& [mind blown hand gesture], "We thought it was some grad school requirement. Like we've had our exams like this for the past 20 years because it had to be." It's like this lore of like well it's always been this way, it's a grad school thing. But really when you go to the source, they're like you all do what you want to do.</b></blockquote>

<p>But this change doesn’t just happen because one person identifies a problem. It takes group buy-in, and also takes structural change, especially if processes have been entrenched in programs for decades.</p>

<blockquote><b>Mandy: And so that was enough for some of the people in our group to say, "Well we're going to have to fix this now, like we want to really dig back into this because if we have the freedom to do it, let's do it." But you first have to get there and then it's like the three people who are here get it, then how they're supposed to go back to their 20 colleagues, and like they all have to kind of be on the same page about it you know. And that's the longer, and it's going to take a longer time for that, but it can be possible but it just takes all those factors coming together. And the work and stopping to think, What do you want them to learn? What should the outcome be? Um but it's just really messy work….I think that's the extra step is like, it does require you to work within the system. So even though you say the system is bad...there is an element of having to work within your existing system to try to amend it and change it. And you have to know what that looks like and you have to be willing to go there, and it's not even just one person individually. Again it's like a whole team has to be willing to go through that which is I think the trickier part.</b></blockquote>

<p>The second digression was on the concept of dérive. Coming from the field of psychogeography, dérive is a way of being in a space, wandering as a way of knowing, allowing a small group of people, often 3-5, to investigate a space/place and allow their attentions to drift and diverge depending on what is around them (Debord; Smith; Bridger; Burnett et al.) Michels et al. used physical dérive in their management education course, sending students out on campus to consider how spaces are designed for students. I was first introduced to the concept of dérive from a former writing center colleague. She was an architecture student, and we were talking about grad school as a system, and I was commenting that I imagined grad school as this process of journeying through different ideas with folx around me, dipping toes into certain areas of study and refining my interests through that journey. She asked me if I had heard of dérive and when I said I hadn’t, she recommended I look it up. While I am not suggesting dérive or psychogeography are faultless (Debord shouldn’t be a role model of any sort), I think the concept of dérive offers a metaphor for what graduate programs can be. Spaces/places designed to allow students to journey with each other, wandering and navigating their own interests with the structures of a discipline/institution; wandering with professors–not in a maze set up to confuse or confound students.</p>

<blockquote><b>Will: I think there's a little bit of like serendipity that happens with research, and like with questions where you go like, "Oh I stumbled upon this." Like so many times you'll hear people, like yeah I kind of just was reading about this and I had this thought, or like you know this idea of stumbling upon….have you heard of like dérive? Um I don't, my French is terrible but it's like d-é-r-i-v-e. Like it's this idea of like play and experiencing the newness with like a small group of like fellow like folks or travelers, like in a space. And so like spaces are designed intentionally to like let people like kind of like wander and like, like be in spaces….And there's always been this like part of me that I like held on to, I was like that's what grad school should be like. It should be a place where like you're with a fellow like group of folks and you're all kind of like in this space and you're asking questions and you're like being together. But also you're like what is this? Like how do I do this? But it's designed in a way to let that happen. Um and so I don't know, it's just like in what ways does this like.<br>

<br>Mandy: I like that and I think it also it reminds me kind of like to go back to your first question about like my research process and journey. I realized recently that the way into this work started with students. I was like oh my god, grad students are struggling, like they don't have the support they need let's learn more about that. And then I moved to, but what about the faculty? They're the ones teaching them, like how how could they use more support to help the students? And then I eventually landed on, oh my god the whole system is broken….And so it's interesting to me, almost like I kind of did wander through it in the way that you're just kind of speaking. Um I didn't realize that I was though, like but I did kind of have some freedom to kind of explore–to use the word that you don't want to use–to like think about different ideas and in different ways that I couldn't have planned it. It just kind of happened, and so there is yeah kind of like how do you make space for that sort of organic formation of ideas and interests? How do you design a space for it? And it happens to some people by circumstance perhaps, but how do we maybe more, just try to systemize that in a way, if we even can? But if we do that, does that get rid of it? I mean I don't know.<br>

<br>Will: Yeah, I don't know. So I again, I keep coming back to the idea of like dérive is like yeah, could that be what grad students, or like my grad you know experience, looks like?</b></blockquote>

<p>There are times when serendipity offers new questions or insights, which may not have stemmed from a traditional route of discovery. Therefore, dérive as a metaphor for graduate education allows different questions of design to be addressed when thinking about master’s programs and doctoral programs, especially using a cohort model. The travelers/wanderers learn from each other, each looking at structures and questions with different perspectives; however, there is an inherent collaborative approach to dérive, one not built on competition but of coexistence.</p>
